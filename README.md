# L515_camera
first upload to github

i will add a full README file soon. but in sort, this is an interface to the L515 Camera that meant for student.
it was build to save and load the output from the camera, save pictures without compression and videos with minimom compression.
the format saved is a color image-8bit, and greyscale-16bit depth image matrices. as you may know, there is no 16bit image format, the code splitte the greyscale-16bit depth into 2 different channels of a RGB image.

if you are a student you may use this code freely :)
